# ETL Project
Personal ETL project utilizing technologies that I want to learn to expand my data engineering skills.

These technologies are:
- API familiarization. Using Python to make API calls to retrieve data (**E**LT)
- Python for loading data into data store (E**L**T)
- Prefect for task orchestration
- dbt for analytical engineering, particularly with data transformations in the EL**T** process
- Streamlit for creating a web application for interactive exploration of the data and data visualizations
